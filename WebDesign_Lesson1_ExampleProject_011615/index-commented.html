<!--
	IMPORTANT TIP FOR NEW CODERS:
	
	Whenever you examine code, whether HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby or
	whatever your journey brings you to, when you find something you don't
	understand, look it up by your favorite search engine to find out
	what it does. Millions before you have asked the same questions, and 
	the answers are all out there! 
	
	For example, if you don't know what the "overflow" attribute in CSS 
	means, typing "css overflow" into your search favorite will bring back 
	lots of results.
	
	Once you learn what the mystery code does and try to use it, if 
	you have trouble, again, search is your friend. "css overflow why scroll
	bars" will quickly tell you that setting "overflow: auto" will cause 
	scroll bars to appear on a container that is smaller than the
	content it is being asked to contain.
	
	And so on. You can achieve great things just by asking questions and 
	trying to understand the answers you read. As an example, I've used 
	Google dozens of times in putting this page together. I can't remember 
    every nuance, but I have a 	general idea of how to approach a problem 
    and then seek out the details.
	
	Speaking of which:
	
	http://stackoverflow.com 
	
	This site deserves special mention as a resource. This is a community-
	based website that you will find over and over in search results when
	you're looking for answers to coding questions. Someone there is an 
	expert on the problem you're facing!
	
	======

	This code will have extensive comments, far more than you would
	normally find. Comments can be minimal for published pages of a public
	website, but anything you do that's "tricky" should be commented in the
	local copy you keep. 
	
	Note I am manually breaking lines for comments; not a requirement, but it 
	does mean that when you have the source open in a narrow window, the nice 
	indentation is kept intact. Also, beware of a minor gotcha in html comments:
	try not to use more than one dash in a row. Some older browsers see two
	or more dashes and think you're done with your comment!
	
	======

	Above, we declared the document to be HTML 5. This comment could be above
	that declaration, but I prefer for the very first item in a page to be 
	code. In some coding languages, extra spaces or comments before the first
	code chunk can kill the script, and therefore it's a good habit to get into.
	
	And we're off!

<html>

	<!--
		The world's most basic web page is this:
		
		<html><head><title></title></head><body></body></html>
		
		Those are the only required elements. So we need to be sure those are
		included in our page.
	-->

	<head>
	
		<!-- 
			Every web page needs a title! Note it is considered good practice
			to repeat the name of the site on inside pages, usually in the form
			of "My Page Title - My Website".
		-->
		
		<title>
			Happy Herders Border Collie Rescue
		</title>
		
		<!-- 
			Next, we're going to set some meta tags:
			
			Character set: It's considered essential to include the character
			set...this information is supposed to be sent by the web server
			but it is not, surprisingly often. "utf-8" is the most common these
			days, as it supports multibyte characters used by many languages.
			
			Description: Just what it says, a short description of the web page.
			Some search engines use this in their search results, and other web 
			services use them as well.
			
			There are many more meta tags - for example, you can use them to redirect pages,
			provide services like Facebook or Twitter with information that will
			make their "share" services work better, and much more.
		-->
			
		<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
		<meta name="description" content="Happy Herders Border Collie Rescue is located in the Puget Sound region of Washington State. We help find new homes for these focused, energetic, and loving dogs.">
		
		<!--
			Every web page needs a style sheet. It will control what your
			page looks like. An ideal to aim for: If you remove your style sheet,
			is your page still readable, with a logical flow of information?
			
			This cannot always be achieved, but we can try! When you come across
			a discussion about separating content from presentation, this is what
			is being talked about. It's an interesting but hairy subject, with
			almost constant exceptions to the rules. But again, aim for the ideal,
			and live with the small compromises you must make.
			
		-->
		
		<link href="includes/happyherders-commented.css" rel="stylesheet">
		
		<!--
			You can link to various scripts in the head, as well,
			but best practice is to place your scripts just before the closing 
			"body" tag - in this way, the main page can load before the site starts
			working on loading and parsing the scripts.
		-->

	</head>
	
	<!--
		Below: The body tag contains the actual content of the page. It's a good idea to
		give it a unique class name, which you can use to reference items in your
		style sheet. There are times in more complex coding where you end up
		"fighting" the styles that are added by software you cannot directly edit.
		Adding a class here is an arrow in your quiver in that fight!
		
		Note that for all HTML elements and their attributes, best practice is to use 
		lowercase letters and dashes.
		
		It is not essential, but also try to stay away from generic class names.
		Again, in your future, you may use some third-party add-ons
		and you may find that a very generic class like 
		"main" is used by the other program. A name like "hh-main" is much 
		better and unlikely to conflict.
	-->

	<body class="hh-page">
	
		<!--
			Using "id" for CSS purposes is nearly identical to using "class", but there 
			are important differences. Namely, IDs must be unique, but classes
			can be repeated. IDs are also very useful for targeting a single item
			on a page; IDs and classes can be used at the same time. When you
			get into JavaScript, you will find yourself doing just that. For example,
			if you had a list of dogs, you might assign the container each is in
			a class of "hh-dog" but also assign each a unique ID, like "hh-dog-7732".
			You can use the class as a way to provide visual style, while using
			the ID to allow a script to, say, highlight "Fido" when her name is
			clicked elsewhere on the page.
			
			See: http://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/
			
			Below I've defined some main containers, and given them IDs for our site.
			We're going to have:
			
				Page top, containing the site name, logo and such.
				
				Page navigation, which contains our, you guessed it, navigation.
				
				Page main, containing the content. This will be divided between a
				main area and a sidebar, a very common web layout.
				
				Page foot, which will contain a few links and contact information.
				
			Within those will be other containers for specific content items. 
			
			When creating a structure like this, think of the process in terms of 
			"what items need to stick together, what items can or should be their own
			container?"
			
			For example, if you put your nav inside the top section (because it's going
			to be horizontal and *looks* like it's part of the page header), it could 
			lead to a lot of editing of every page if you decide six months from now
			to make it vertical, beside the main content.
			
			On the other hand, if you know the sidebar will always be beside the main
			content, it makes sense to group them in the same container.
			
			Note that I've commented next to some closing "div" tags what div id they're 
			closing. This is helpful on long pages when you're coding and come across 
			what seems like a random closing div..."what's that from?"
			
		-->
		
		
		<!--
			One of the biggest favors you can do yourself when building web pages, especially
			as you start to try more complex layouts, is to surround your entire page
			layout with a container div. 
			
			This allows you a lot more flexibility to 
			style your page. (You can style
			some aspects of the "body" tag, but not a lot.) Here,
			this will allow us to give the body a different background color,
			and to make hh-container into a box containing the page.

						Welcome to Happy Herders!
					</h1>
					<p>
						<strong>Border collies</strong> are intense, loyal and very smart dogs that can range in size from under 20 to over 60 pounds--they are known and bred for their very strong herding instincts, put to good use by shepherds the world over. While they can live happily in apartments, border collies need "work"--things to do both mentally and physically, such as learning tricks and playing ball--and are not a good choice for people who want a dog they can leave alone for long periods.
					</p>
					<p>
						<img src="images/front_large.jpg" width="540" height="361" alt="courtesy of http://www.flickr.com/photos/lillymanion/">
					</p>
					<p>
						Border collies will repay your investment of time and dedication by displaying amazing loyalty, and will astound you with their smarts. It is not a coincidence that when you learn of an incredible canine feat, it's very often a border collie as the featured hero. It doesn't hurt their popularity that they are among the most beautiful dogs in the world, either!
					</p>
					<p>
						(We <em>think</em> this is all part of their plan for world domination, but we're not smart enough to understand their plan!)
					</p>
					<p>
						Border collies are mostly "working dogs", with far looser restrictions on appearance than an AKC breed<sup>*</sup>, and therefore can display a large range of coats, coloring, size and temperaments. This generally means they have far fewer genetic problems than a "purebred" dog, and it's not difficult to find a border collie suited to you and your lifestyle.
					</p>
					<p>
						Please note, though, that their intelligence, strong herding instincts and high energy levels make them potentially difficult companions for families with young children or for individuals unable to give them the attention and exercise they need.
					</p>
					<ul class="footnote">
						<li>
							There are AKC border collies now, a move not without controversy. At Happy Herders we don't pay any attention to whether a dog is AKC registered or not, and much prefer the healthier approach a "working dog" breeder takes!
