					<h1>
						Donate and Help Us Rescue Border Collies
					</h1>
					<p>
						We do accept some donations of materials, supplies and services, but the way you can help most is by donating cash. We are not a registered charity, so your donations will not be tax-deductible, but our books are open to significant donors.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you like, you can sponsor a specific dog in our rescue, and we'll keep you updated on their stay and how they fare at their new home, as and if we get updates. We suggest a $100 donation to sponsor a dog.
					</p>
					<p>
						The border collies we rescue range from docile house pets to dogs with significant behavioral issues. Because of this, we generally aren't looking for volunteers to help out here on the farm, as the risk--both to you and the dogs--is too great. If you have <em>significant</em> experience directly related to working with border collies, please drop us a line. Otherwise, we appreciate the interest but sadly cannot take advantage of your kindness. 
					</p>
					<p>
						To donate, please send a check to the address below, or PayPal your donation to <a href="mailto:hh@example.com">hh@example.com</a>. If sponsoring a specific dog, please let us know which border collie from our adopt list is going to be the lucky boy or girl!

						<h3>
							Currently Needed Items
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<h5>Dog Food</h5>
								<p>
									We go through about 100 pounds of food per month. We prefer to buy our own, but contact us if you have <strong>Acme Brand - Active Dog</strong> you would like to donate.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h5>Tug Toys</h5>
								<p>
									Border collies are tough on toys, but we've found that Acme Tuggers stand up well, and we'll accept new medium and small sizes of their "Tough Dog" model.
