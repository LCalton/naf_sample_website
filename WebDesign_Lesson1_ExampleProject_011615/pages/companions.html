						Adopt a Companion!
					</h1>
					<p>
						These border collies are just that bit mellower than the athletes and would make excellent pets. They still love working but have the ability to occasionally sit back and enjoy life from the comfort of a nice squishy dog bed.

									Countess is a lovely girl, very affectionate and mellow. She has thyroid issues and needs pills with her daily meal--expect a cost of around $30 a month. She is fit and enjoys exercise but gets tuckered out quickly (for a border collie). Good with cats, dogs, kids and strangers!

									Stripe

								<p>
									Stripe is a friendly guy, always ready for a snuggle. When he was a pup he was mauled, which left him with a permanent gimpy leg and a fear of other dogs. He can get along well with other quiet dogs but does poorly with outgoing animals. His leg injury limits his ability to run but he loves walking and is good on leash if his person can intervene if another dog approaches.

									Salvo is the class clown. If he were a person, you'd say he was 50 going on 15, and that's just what he is. He's slowing down a bit but is still fit and loves to exercise; it just takes less time to wear him out. He's a prankster and should only be homed with tolerant dogs. Great with kids.

And now for a bit of magic!

This page is absolutely identical in structure to the other adoption page (athletes.html)--we're using the magic of JavaScript, via the jQuery framework, and a plug-in for jQuery called "jQuery Cycle" to make the adoption dog boxes into a slideshow. Take a look at the very bottom of this page to see how this was done. The code between here and there is identical, the only change is the JavaScript added at the end.

This is well beyond the scope of this class, but a taste of things to come hopefully will whet your appetite!

		<script type="text/javascript" src="../extras/jquery.cycle.all.js"></script>
		<script>
			$( document ).ready(function() {

				$('#hh-adopt-container').cycle({ 
					fx:    'fade', 
					timeout:  5000,
					pause:  1 
				});
			
			});
		</script>

<!--

Explaining what is happening here is way beyond the scope of what you're learning, but 
just like embedding a YouTube video is amazing the first time you do it and can completely
inspire you to learn more, my hope is this brief peek into the power of JavaScript will
prompt a similar desire.
