									Rocky is a boisterous guy, always ready for a new adventure. His energy level is high, though he does not have much of a herding instinct, so a better bet to wear him out would be agility or simple running. He loves people and is very friendly. Rocky is still working on his recall so he cannot be in an unfenced area unless he's on a leash. Rocky gets along well with other dogs.

									Sprite is one focused dog! She is clearly happy to see you, but doesn't want to cuddle for more than a minute or so before it's time for work. Sprite has the talent and focus to be a very, very good agility dog. Sprite is looking for someone who will take pride in her accomplishments and is willing to work hard with her, but who doesn't demand hugs at the end of the day.

									Becky likes nothing more than a game of ball. She needs to be the only dog in her new home, but she <em>loves</em> people. Becky is an excellent companion and perfect for someone looking to have a border collie who thinks the sun rises and sets with her human.
